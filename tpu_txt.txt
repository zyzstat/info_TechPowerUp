NVIDIA Enables GPU Passthrough for Virtual Machines on Consumer-Grade GeForce GPUs
----------------------------------------

-----------------Content----------------
Editor's note: This is not a part of April Fools.

NVIDIA has separated professional users and regular gamers with the company's graphics card offering. There is a GeForce lineup of GPUs, which represents a gaming-oriented version and its main task is to simply play games, display graphics, and run some basic CUDA accelerated software. However, what would happen if you were to start experimenting with your GPU? For example, if you are running Linux, and you want to spin a virtual machine with Windows on it for gaming, you could just use your integrated GPU as the GeForce card doesn't allow for virtual GPU passthrough. For these purposes, NVIDIA has its professional graphics card lineup like Quadro and Tesla.

However, this specific feature is about to arrive in even the GeForce lineup offerings. NVIDIA has announced that the company is finally bringing the basic virtual machine passthrough functions to the gaming GPUs. While the feature is representing a step in the right direction, it is still limited. For example, the GeForce GPU passthrough supports only one virtual machine and SR-IOV feature is still not supported on GeForce. "If you want to enable multiple virtual machines to have direct access to a single GPU or want the GPU to be able to assign virtual functions to multiple virtual machines, you will need to use NVIDIA Tesla, Quadro, or RTX enterprise GPUs.", says the NVIDIA FAQ. GeForce virtualization, which is now still in beta, is supported on R465 or higher drivers. The full content from NVIDIA's website is written below.

COMPUTEX 2021 Physical Show Cancelled, Will be Held Online Only
----------------------------------------

-----------------Content----------------
TAITRA, the COMPUTEX organizer, has announced that the physical COMPUTEX event has been cancelled (surprising maybe some three or four people in the world). The organizer cites ongoing COVID-19 concerns (including the world's current state of vaccination levels) that would put the safety of attendees on the line, and has thus elected to forego the physical event and focus only on an online capacity. 

However, even as the physical event has been cancelled, TAITRA doubled down on the virtual COMPUTEX event. Marketed #COMPUTEXVirtual, the event is scheduled to run for a full month, from May 31st to June 30th, in what marks COMPUTEX's first attempt at doing a large-scale virtual event. TAITRA had this to say on their decision: "With another wave of coronavirus pandemic across the world, it doesn't look like we are close to the end. The majority of the show's stakeholders, including international exhibitors, visitors, and media, cannot join the show due to border control. Therefore, the organizers of COMPUTEX have decided to cancel the onsite exhibition this year."

Intel Could Rename its Semiconductor Nodes to Catch Up with the Industry
----------------------------------------

-----------------Content----------------
In the past few years, Intel has struggled a lot with its semiconductor manufacturing. Starting from the 10 nm fiasco, the company delayed the new node for years and years, making it seem like it is never going to get delivered. The node was believed to be so advanced that it was unexpectedly hard to manufacture, giving the company more problems. Low yields have been present for a long time, and it is only recently that Intel has started shipping its 10 nm products. However, its competitor, TSMC, has been pumping out nodes at an amazing rate. At the time of writing, the Taiwanese giant is producing the 5 nm node, with a 4 nm node on the way.

So to remain competitive, Intel would need to apply a new tactic. The company has a 7 nm node in the works for 2023 when TSMC will switch to the 3 nm+ nodes. That represents a marketing problem, where the node naming convention is making Intel inferior to its competitors. To fix that, the company will likely start node renaming and give its nodes new names, that are corresponding to the industry naming conventions. We still have no information how will the new names look like, or if Intel will do it in the first place, so take this with a grain of salt.

TSMC to Enter 4 nm Node Volume Production in Q4 of 2021
----------------------------------------

-----------------Content----------------
TSMC, the world leader in semiconductor manufacturing, has reportedly begun with plans to start volume production of the 4 nm node by the end of this year. According to the sources over at DigiTimes, Taiwan's leading semiconductor manufacturer could be on the verge of starting volume production of an even smaller node. The new 4 nm node is internally referred to as a part of the N5 node generation. The N5 generation covers N5 (regular 5 nm), N5P (5 nm+), and N4 process that is expected to debut soon. And perhaps the most interesting thing is that the 4 nm process will be in high-volume production in Q4, with Apple expected to be one of the major consumers of the N5 node family.

DigiTimes reports that Apple will use the N5P node for the upcoming Apple A15 SoCs for next-generation iPhones, while the more advanced N4 node will find itself as a base of the new Macs equipped with custom Apple Silicon SoCs. To find out more, we have to wait for the official product launches and see just how much improvement new nodes bring.

AMD Outs 32 MB Infinity Cache on Navi 23, No Cache on Upcoming Van Gogh APUs
----------------------------------------

-----------------Content----------------
AMD has revealed the Infinity Cache size for the upcoming Navi 23 GPU, as well as its absence in the next-generation Van Gogh APU, which features Zen 2 cores and an RDNA GPU. The reveal comes via a new patch done by AMD to the AMKFD, a Linux kernel HSA driver for AMD APUs. The patch file doesn't list Infinity Cache per se, but does clarify the last-level cache for AMD's GPUs - L3, which is essentially the same.

The patch reveals L3 size for Sienna Cichlid (Navi 21), Navy Flounder (Navi 22), and Dimgrey Cavefish (Navi 23). Navi 21 features 128*1024 (128 MB) of Infinity Cache, the just-released Navi 22 has 96 MB, as we know, and according to the file, Navi 23 is bound to feature 32 MB of it. Considering that Van Gogh lacks an infinity Cache, it would seem that it's making use of previous-gen Navi graphics, and won't leverage RDNA2, of which the Infinity Cache is a big part of. It remains to be seen if Van Gogh will materialize in an APU product lineup or if it's a specific part for a customer. It also remains to be seen which RX product will Navi 23 power - if an AMD RX 66000 series, or 6500 series.

MonsterLabo Plays Flight Simulator with The Beast, Achieves Fully-Fanless Gaming Experience
----------------------------------------

-----------------Content----------------
MonsterLabo, the maker of fanless PC cases designed for gaming with zero noise, has today tested its upcoming flagship offering in the case lineup. Called The Beast, the case is designed to handle high-end hardware with large TDPs and dissipate all that heat without any moving parts. Using only big heatsinks and heat pipes to transfer the heat to the big heatsink area. In a completely fanless configuration, the case can absorb and dissipate a CPU TDP of 150 Watts and a GPU TPD with 250 Watts. However, when equipped with two 140 mm fans running below 500 RPM, it can accommodate a 250 W CPU, and 320 W GPU. MonsterLabo has tested the fully fanless configuration, which was equipped with AMD Ryzen 7 3800XT processor, paired with NVIDIA's latest GeForce RTX 3080 Ampere graphics card. 

There were no fans present in the system to help move the heat away, and the PC was being stress-tested using Microsoft's Flight Simulator. The company has posted a chart of CPU and GPU temperatures over time, where we see that the GPU has managed to hit about 75 degrees Celsius at one point. The CPU has remained a bit cooler, where the CPU package hit just above the 70-degree mark. Overall, the case is more than capable of cooling the hardware it was equipped with. By adding two slow-spinning fans, the temperatures would get even lower, however, that is no longer a fanless system. MonsterLabo's The Beast is expected to get shipped in Q3 of this year when reviewers will get their hands on it and test it for themselves. You can watch the videos in MonsterLabo's blog post here.

Massive Cyberpunk 2077 1.2 Update Fixes Tons of Bugs, Adds Raytracing for AMD
----------------------------------------

-----------------Content----------------
This article serves as a way to sate my curiosity: does anyone even care about Cyberpunk 2077 anymore, or was the release state of the game (and the terrible media surrounding it and CD Projekt Red) enough for people to forget what likely was the world's most anticipated game ever? While this editor had loads of fun playing the game in a PS4 Pro system, such wasn't the case for many, many players - and especially for PS4 players, who couldn't even buy the game from the PS store after a certain point, and still can't. CD Projekt Red has, since the game's release, launched 11 patches that fixed a myriad of bugs and optimized the games' performance - but a ton of issues still remain, and remained.

Now, update 1.2, the second in the two major bug-fixing updates for the game, is being ready for prime-time, and there's a veritable laundry list of fixes on offer. The intention is for this update to solve most of the underlying, fixable issues that don't require reworking of core gameplay aspects of the game, paving the way for the upcoming free DLC and downloadable expansions which are sure to be coming - at least one throughout 2021 seems not only plausible, but extremely likely. But is this enough? Do you still have faith in this game and hope CD Projekt Red pulls a No Man's Sky from Cyberpunk 2077? Or is it far away in your rearview mirror, abandoned in a dystopian setting? In either case, the full list of fixes follows after the break; just looking at it is more than enough information to see the state of the game now, almost four months after launch. Two things to point out: raytracing is now supported on AMD graphics cards, with the latest drivers; and there's an interesting "and many more" in the end of the patch notes. Update 19:36 UTC: The patch is live now! Download size is around 30 GB. Or 55 GB if you're on a PlayStation.

Nintendo Game Boy Modded to Mine Bitcoin
----------------------------------------

-----------------Content----------------
Nintendo's Game Boy handheld console was launched in 1989, making it 32 years old. Being widely regarded as the icon of handheld gaming, it was sold in millions and has been copied countless times. However, with some spare time and a crazy mind, the console has been modified to mine Bitcoin cryptocurrency. Yes, you are reading that right. An 8-bit console is mining the biggest and the most valuable cryptocurrency. An electronics enthusiast named "stacksmashing" has set himself a difficult task - to prove that the console can mine some Bitcoin, at any possible rate. And he has managed to prove it is possible, although with some modifications.

Given that the console lacks any connectivity options to the outside world due to its age, the modder had to use SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) to connect the Game Boy with the Raspberry Pi, which had the task of connecting the Game Boy to the internet to mine some Bitcoin. Using the custom 8-bit Sharp LR35902 processor running at 4.19 MHz, the console is naturally not very powerful. Thus, it can not do any meaningful mining and to compare it to modern mining ASICs is just silly. However, it is interesting to see proof of concept and get to see some engineering fun.

Intel Core i9-11900K Breaks 7 GHz Barrier at 1.873 V
----------------------------------------

-----------------Content----------------
Intel Core i9-11900K processor, the flagship model from the 11th generation "Rocket Lake" CPU lineup, has been overclocked to more than 7 GHz by the "Rog-Fisher". Thanks to the report coming from VideoCardz, we have information that the top-end Rocket Lake processor is possibly a very good overclocker. Running at 7048 MHz, the CPU managed to achieve that frequency using "only" 1.873 V. There is no doubt that the system was being cooled by LN2, as such overclocks need it to remain stable, however, we don't have any data on that. The CPU was paired with the ASUS ROG Maximus XIII Apex motherboard, designed for extreme overclocking purposes.

It is important to note that the CPU didn't run any benchmarks, as it was just validated at that frequency by Valid x86. The sample was likely supplied by Intel, so it could be a cherry-picked model. For the official benchmark results of Rocket Lake processors, we have to wait until tomorrow (March 30th), when NDA lifts.

NVIDIA Repurposing Scrapped RTX 3080 Ti GA102-250 GPUs to GA102-300 for RTX 3090
----------------------------------------

-----------------Content----------------
The NVIDIA RTX 3080 Ti has experienced numerous delays with the card's launch most recently being pushed to mid-May. The unreleased RTX 3080 Ti has gone through various internal revisions with the card expected to use a GA102-250 GPU until plans were scrapped in late January. The RTX 3080 Ti is now expected to feature the GA102-225 GPU instead when it finally releases. NVIDIA having already produced the required processors is now repurposing the GA102-250 GPUs slated for the RTX 3080 Ti for use in RTX 3090 Founders Edition cards. This switch makes sense as the GA102-250 was rumored to feature the same number of cores as the RTX 3090 just with a smaller memory size. NVIDIA appears to have now enabled the full 384-bit memory bus and has laser engraved the chips to show their change to GA102-300's.
